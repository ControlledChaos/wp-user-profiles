== Description ==

WP User Cards is a more modern way to view all of the users in your individual sites.

Cards are used to show users in a favorable way rather than listing them in a table like other faceless objects.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with multisite? =

This only replaces the user list on individual sites, because the Network interface is commonly used as a more utilitarian tool.

= Can I customize the card output? =

Yes. There are a few actions & filters inserted before and after some hard-coded output. In a future version, we may explore the idea of auto-populating more data based on registered columns, metadata, etc...

= Where can I get support? =

The WordPress support forums: https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-user-cards/
