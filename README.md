# WP User Cards

WP User Cards is a more modern way to view all of the users in your individual sites.

Cards are used to show users in a favorable way rather than listing them in a table like other faceless objects.

# Installation

* Download and install using the built in WordPress plugin installer.
* Activate in the "Plugins" area of your admin by clicking the "Activate" link.
* No further setup or configuration is necessary.

# FAQ

### Does this work with multisite?

This only replaces the user list on individual sites, because the Network interface is commonly used as a more utilitarian tool.

### Can I customize the card output?

Yes. There are a few actions & filters inserted before and after some hard-coded output. In a future version, we may explore the idea of auto-populating more data based on registered columns, metadata, etc...

### Where can I get support?

The WordPress support forums: https://wordpress.org/plugin/support/wp-user-cards/

### Can I contribute?

Yes, please!
